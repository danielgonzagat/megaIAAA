"""
Conscious-Ingest Example - Short-Term Working Memory

This example demonstrates how conscious_ingest=True works:
- At startup: Conscious agent analyzes long-term memory patterns
- Promotes 5-10 essential conversations to short-term memory storage
- Injects this working memory ONCE at the first LLM call
- Like human short-term memory: names, current projects, preferences readily available
- No repeated injection during the same session (one-shot behavior)
