Test script for the new conscious_ingest functionality

This script demonstrates how the conscious agent works:
1. Records conversations in long-term memory
2. Analyzes patterns to extract essential personal facts
3. Stores facts in short-term memory for immediate context
4. Prioritizes essential facts in context injection
