# Technology Map

The **megaIAAA** repository aggregates multiple AI research projects.
This map highlights core components:

- **Reinforcement Learning**: environments and algorithms such as RLLTE.
- **Large Language Models**: transformer libraries and agent frameworks.
- **Distributed Systems**: integration with Ray for scalable execution.

See `WHITE_PAPER.md` for a deeper discussion of these systems.
