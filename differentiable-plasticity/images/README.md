## Images

This code implements the image completion task: three images are shown several times, then one of the image is half-erased and presented, and the network must reconstruct the missing portion of the image.

To run this code, you must download the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) (Python version), and copy the `data_batch_*` files into this directory.
